    <h1>Reaction Time Test</h1>
    <p>This website is meant to be a fast and easy to use tool to measure your reaction time. Click on the button below to start the game. You will see a red button, click it as soon as it turns green!</p>
    <button onclick="reactionButtonClicked()" id="reaction_button">Click here to start</button>

        <p class="infoBoxParagraph">The average results obtained with this test range from 310 to 340ms. To that you need to subtract the latency of your computer and monitor (10-50ms) and the time you hold your mouse button down during a click (around 50-60ms).</p>

        <p class="infoBoxParagraph">Reflexes do slow with age. Physical changes in nerve fibers slow the speed of conduction. And the parts of the brain involved in motor control lose cells over time. But the effect of age on reflexes and reaction time varies greatly from person to person. You can actually slow down, even reverse, the effects of aging by staying physically active. Remember the saying: If you don't use it, you'll lose it.</p>
